<h1>WordCat help file</h1>

<h2>What's the goal of this application?</h2>
<p>I had to merge a lot of Word documents located in different folders. These files could me modified almost anytime, so I had to develop this tool. <br />
It takes the order you give into account for merging files, so you don't have to use some weird filenames to organize your final document.
</p>

<h2>Advantages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Files and directories with a name beginning with a dash are ignored.</li>
<li>Non-latin characters into Word documents are naturally supported.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to use this application</h2>
<ol class="howto">
<li>Select a target folder and an optional template (located in the same folder):<img src="target.png" /></li>
<li>Use the arrows to move up/down the selected file, or use the <i>A-Z</i> icon to sort them alphabetically:<img src="../sort.png" /></li>
<li>Once you've browsed each folder, use the <i>Check</i> button to verify whether all documents are referenced.</li>
<li>If it succeeds, click on the <i>Run</i> button and select the method you prefer. The result will be stored in a file called <i>merge.doc</i> into the target directory's root.<br />
The application will automatically open it for reviewing. Always do some visual checks before printing it!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Known bug</h2>
<p>Concatenating files with headers/footers may cause some problems. <br />
Try removing them via the integrated tool (<i>Tools</i> &rarr; <i>Remove headers/footers</i>) after making a backup...<br />
This bug is actually due to Microsoft Word's bad headers/footers management.</p>

<h2>Todo list</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ordering with multiple selections</li>
<li>Support .docx files?</li>
<li>Command-line support (with exit code)</li>
</ul>
